                    <ul>
                        <li>The games starts with everyone, besides the dealer, placing a bet.</li>
                        <li>The dealer deals 2 facing up cards to the player and 2 cards to theirself, only one faces up.</li>
                        <li>Card 2 through 10 are scored using their face value.</li>
                        <li>J, Q, K are all equal to 10. A can be 1 or 11.</li>
                        <li>The goal of the game is having a hand that scores higher than the dealers' but doesn't totals higher than 21.</li>
                        <li>If your hand scores higher than 21, you lose the round. It also can be referred to as a BUST.</li>
                        <li>You win automatically if you score 21. If you score lower than 21, you can choose either "HIT" to draw one more card or 
                            "STAND" to keep your current cards.</li>
                        <li>If the dealer's facing up card is an ACE, you can hit "INSURANCE" and make a side bet. If the dealer scores 21, you receive your side 
                            bet 2x, otherwise, you lose it.</li>
                        <li>Once you choose "STAND", the dealer flips up his facing down card. If their score is less than or equal to 16,
                             mandatorily, they will have to get one more card. </li>
